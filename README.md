Currently I am coding at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) for the [RPM Software Management](https://github.com/rpm-software-management)

At the moment my **main interests** are: C, C++ and Python Languages, System development, Distributed Systems, Self Hosting and digital sovereignty, Metal and the magical malted water of Scotland.
